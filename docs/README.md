# n00blib
**n00blib** is a simple, lightweight Java game library built by a n00b, for a n00b. It is deployed under the [GNU GPL v3](LICENSE).

**n00blib** is currently in **heavy develpment**; consider this a preview. Although it currently lacks some pretty basic features such as changing text font/size, that will be implemented in the near future. Also, any issues or pull requests will **NOT BE** ignored, and probably be addressed in the next few days.

## So what does it do?
**n00blib** deals with the `JFrame`s, `GLCanvas`s, `GLEventListener`s, and all of that internally, leaving you with a straightforward game developing environment. For further information on the functionalities of n00blib and how to use them, click [here](Installation) to get started.
