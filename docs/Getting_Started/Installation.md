# Installation

To get started with n00blib, you have to install it first.

There are 2 ways to do so; you can either
1. Clone the src folder and compile it
or
2. Just download the `n00blib.jar`
and then add it to the build path of your Java project.

Before you do so, however, please ensure that all [dependencies](#dependencies) are intalled and/or configured...

## Dependencies
