# n00blib

**n00blib** is a simple, lightweight Java game library built by a n00b, for a n00b. It is deployed under the [GNU GPL v3](LICENSE).

**n00blib** is currently in **heavy develpment**; consider this a preview. Although it currently lacks some pretty basic features such as changing text font/size, that will be implemented in the near future. Also, any issues or pull requests will **NOT BE** ignored, and probably be addressed in the next few days. Don't believe me? *n00blib version 1.1 was released about 2 hours after the initial version.* Do you believe me now?

## Installation
To intall **n00blib**, you can either
1. Clone the src folder and compile it
or
2. Just download the `n00blib.jar`
and then add it to the build path of your Java project.

Before you do so, however, please ensure that all [dependencies](#dependencies) are intalled and/or configured.

## Dependencies
### JRE
**n00blib** was tested in JRE 1.8.0_131. Although it should run without any issues in earlier versions of JRE, it is recommended that you use JRE 1.8.0_131 or higher.
### JOGL
**n00blib** uses JOGL, the Java port of OpenGL, for graphics. Click [here](https://jogamp.org/wiki/index.php/Setting_up_a_JogAmp_project_in_your_favorite_IDE) for a detailed guide on the intallation of JOGL. Make sure to add JOGL to your project's build path once you install it.
